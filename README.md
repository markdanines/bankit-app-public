## General Info
Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript, I created a banking application that works for both desktop and mobile users, which allow users to view transactions, make deposit, withdrawals, and transfers. 

The aim of this project was to implement a banking application similar to the banking applications that we use on a day-to-day basis. 

## Technologies
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap v4.1.1
* Font Awesome v5.0.13
* Javascript
* Dependencies - Jquery v3.3.1, Popper v1.14.3

## Setup
To run this application, open index.html in a browser.

## Usage
In order to access application features, a login is required. A default login of Card Number: '12345678', and Pin '1234' is automatically inputted, but in order to access the other account, a Card Number of '87654321' and Pin '1234' must be entered. By having access to both account, the user will be able to test the transfer feature in the applicatiion.
